# 👋 Hey, I’m Solomon!

Big fan of **JavaScript/TypeScript**, Following the Rust hype. Always learning, tinkering, and shipping stuff. 🌱  

## 🌱 Currently Playing With
- Advanced React patterns & performance tweaks  
- Rust CLI and trying to make my ASCII logo just right!
- React Moldule Fedration, BHvR Stack, Database Driven UI
- GSAP and Motion animations, cant lie scroll sequences are really cool

✨ When I’m not coding, I’m gaming (sometimes), exploring new tech, or pretending to go outdoors. Feel free to reach out if you want to build cool things together! 🚀
